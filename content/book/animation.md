keywords: animations, frames, timing

To create an animation or a video, we need a rapid sequence of still images, rapid enough that it looks like a smoothly changing pattern to our yes. This is true both for the computer screen playing a video and for the SpinWheel lights, changing their light patterns. For example, this is a short repeating animation of a rainbow pattern playing on the LEDs.

We will first start with a simpler animation. Teach parameterized animations, just change brightness.

Then we will describe how the same way we parameterized with respect to time, we can parameterize with respect to position.

Lastly, we will introduce a couple of convenience functions.
