This lesson needs to explain the header image, that is **ALL** it needs to do. The "inertial reference frames" title is a bit misleading. This is more of a lessons about the "equivalency principle" and how inertial mass and gravitational mass are indistinguishable as far as we know.

Our device has a sensor that measures acceleration, but we have to subtract 1g from the measurement to use it for most things. Explaining this would be a nice "stretch goal" for our lessons.

We do **not** need to talk about ineral forces and centripetal vs centrifugal, that would be way too advanced.

Suggested structure:
- How do you know you are moving? By looking at things that you say are "stationary". But there is some arbitrariness to what you call stationary.
- How do you know gravity is pulling you down (besides the intense sense of depression deep in your soul)? You look at whether things (or you) fall with ever increasing speed to the center of attraction if there is no support under you. But then, can you distinguish an elevator in free fall from no gravity at all (not counting the moment when you go *splat*)?
- Maybe also add that in the same way you can not distinguish being in a box in a gravity field from being in an accelerating box without gravity?
- Definitely bring up that at the very start of an elevator trip you "feel" higher gravity and also lower gravity at the end of a as it is stopping. Or the inverse if the elevator is going down instead of up.

todo: Sketch that makes the spinwheel shine when it experiences acceleration. See it is dark when thrown in the air. See it is bright when shaken or rotated around holder. See it brighten up in an elevator, but only at a start of a trip.
