This lesson needs to explain the header image, that is **ALL** it needs to do. The "inertial reference frames" title is a bit misleading. This is more of a lessons about the "equivalency principle" and how inertial mass and gravitational mass are indistinguishable as far as we know.

Our device has a sensor that measures acceleration, but we have to subtract 1g from the measurement to use it for most things. Explaining this would be a nice "stretch goal" for our lessons.

We do **not** need to talk about ineral forces and centripetal vs centrifugal, that would be way too advanced.

Suggested structure:
- How do you know you are moving? By looking at things that you say are "stationary". But there is some arbitrariness to what you call stationary.
I'm working on the language for this but comparing this riding in a car vs. someone sitting on a park bench by the rode. This is how I'll introduce refrence inertial frames. 
This example rely's on sight, and seeing things pass by
On second thought, this is going to be someone riding on a rocket that can first travel on the road, and can later take off. This will be a nicer transition


Add a box that the park bench is not "stationary" by every definition, as it is attached to Earth which rotates and travels arond the sun 
State that we won't explore that any further in this lesson


I'll transition to the idea of non-inertial refrence frames after by talking about closer your eyes during a car ride, and a car speeding up or slowing down. Transition to elevator and gravity


An elevator, or a rocket ship is now moving in the vertical direction and we will consider accelerating refrence frames
Note that gravity is a force that causes acceleration

Now imagine you are riding in an elevator, and the string suddenly breaks.
You can't see anything, so how would you know that you are falling?
Now imagine with you, there was a box that weight 50 lbs on Earth. If you had a scale in the elevator and placed the box on the scale, it wouldn't weigh anything because the entire elevator, you, and the box would be accelerating (falling).

- How do you know gravity is pulling you down (besides the intense sense of depression deep in your soul)? You look at whether things (or you) fall with ever increasing speed to the center of attraction if there is no support under you. But then, can you distinguish an elevator in free fall from no gravity at all (not counting the moment when you go *splat*)?

-Now imagine taking your rocket ship far away to a place where there is no gravity. 
Just like in the elevator, if your box and a scale on board, it would not weigh anything. So we can not distinguish a frame in free fall with gravity, from a frame where there is no gravity. 

- Maybe also add that in the same way you can not distinguish being in a box in a gravity field from being in an accelerating box without gravity?
- Definitely bring up that at the very start of an elevator trip you "feel" higher gravity and also lower gravity at the end of a as it is stopping. Or the inverse if the elevator is going down instead of up.
This could also be explained by the idea of putting a box and scale in the elevator

todo: Sketch that makes the spinwheel shine when it experiences acceleration. See it is dark when thrown in the air. See it is bright when shaken or rotated around holder. See it brighten up in an elevator, but only at a start of a trip.
