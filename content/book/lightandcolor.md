You might have heard that light is "just" an electromagnetic wave. This
statement is true, but on its own it simply replaces one mystery with another:
what is an electromagnetic wave? For starters, a wave is some form of traveling
repetitive motion in some medium. Interestingly, the wave can travel from one
point to another without the need for the medium itself to travel that
distance. For instance, the crests for a sea wave can be ridden all the way to
the shore, but very little of the sea water actually travels along (similarly
to the crest of a wave in a carpet). When our ears hear a sound, they are
detecting the vibration caused by a wave traveling in the air.

Waves are characterized by their frequency (how often the repetitive motion is
repeated) and speed (how fast the waves moves forward to new parts of the
medium in which it travels). The speed of sound waves is hundreds of meters per
second (1mâ‰ˆ3ft). The frequency of vibrations we can hear is between 20 to 20000
Hz (one Hertz is one vibration per second). Anything vibrating more rapidly
than that is called ultra sound and we have machines that can detect it, but
our ears can not. Anything under 20 Hz is also not audible, but we might be
able to feel the vibrations with our fingers.

Electromagnetic waves are also waves, like sound waves, but instead of being
made of traveling vibrations in matter, they are vibrations of... it is
complicated. There are many metaphors we can use to describe the medium that
electromagnetic waves vibrate in, and studying its inner workings has led to
the greatest discoveries in Physics: general relativity and quantum mechanics.
Instead of retracing the steps of physicists over two hundred years, we will
give an engineer's description of light, based what we can measure about it
with the devices the physicists have created.
