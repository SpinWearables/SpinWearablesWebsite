The SpinWheel STEM kit can optionally contain a paper booklet, meant as a gentler introduction to 
some of the concepts taught by the kit. All of the content of the book is already accessible
through this website, in many cases including a richer multimedia experience, however the paper
medium can occasionally feel more approachable and intimate. Therefore, the PDF rendition of the
booklet is available for download and printing at the links below:
