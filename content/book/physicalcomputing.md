# The Virtual and the Real World

Over the last century computers have created a whole new world for us to
explore, a world of abstract patterns, mathematics, and art. The virtual world,
as we call it, includes the Internet and all tools and services you have ever
accessed through electronic devices. The tools we have created in that world
enabled much of our progress in science and mathematics, and even spurred new
forms of art.

However, there is a vast class of tasks for which we need to connect the
virtual world to our physical surroundings if we are to wield the powers it
grants us. For instance, a weather simulator used to predict the
weather needs a network of sensors that inform it of the current state of the
atmosphere. On a smaller scale, a thermostat needs to measure the current
temperature before it commands the air conditioner or furnace to turn on. For
most of this chapter, we will focus on such smaller scales.

The engineering (and art) discipline studying these physical-virtual
connections is frequently referred to as "physical computing" or "embedded
electronics" (because the computing hardware is "embedded" in another device).


```c++
void main() {
  int i;
  i++;
}
```
