# Structure of this textbook

The document has an introductory track explaining how to set up the device, a number parallel lesson tracks in physics and computer science. The lessons are of increasing sophistication and you are encouraged to read through the introductory physics lessons before you tackle the advanced computer science lessons and vice versa. Lastly, there is an "adventures" track and an "engineer's diary".

This document uses a couple of special blocks to call attention to important topics.

::: further-reading :
Panels like this one serve as suggestions for extra materials to be read. For instance, you might be interested in looking up the [first public document written in markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), describing the markup language.
:::

::: warning :
And panels like this one warn you of impending doom. For instance, it seems pretty clear that due to the lack of political will in the ruling class, our planet will experience an environmental catastrophe unseen since oxygen producing organism evolved in the primordial oceans.
:::

::: for-educators :
Occasionally we will also provide suggestions for parents or educators on what to add to a lesson.

Code blocks are used to write and explain code:

```c++
void main() {
  int i;
  i++;
}
```

Inline and display math are available: $e^{ix}=\sin{x} + i \cos{x}$.

$$ \operatorname{f}(x)=\sum_{n=0}\frac{1}{n!}\frac{\mathrm{d}^n\operatorname{f}(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^n}. $$

Pictures can be added too, [in particular xkcd style plots](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/showcase/xkcd.html#sphx-glr-gallery-showcase-xkcd-py).

```python
matplotlib.plt.xkcd()
```

## Setting up your device

Download the Arduino IDE and our library.

## The Physics Track

Learn to bend the nature of reality to your whim. Master the eldritch forces, twisting space and time to do your bidding. Gods will scream in horror once they face you, for you wield the methods of rationality.

## The Computer Science Track

Ooh, I can make this square blink when I click on a button! And I can create my own virtual universe, the laws of logic being the only constraints to my creation.
