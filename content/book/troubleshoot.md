It can be frustrating when your code doesn't work 
or you can't get the software to recognize the SpinWheel.
We've created this page to help you become more comfortable troubleshooting what is wrong with the SpinWheel for yourself.
These tips will help you tackle the difficulties you encounter and 
learn how to get better at diagnosing problems yourself.
As you get more comfortable with programming the SpinWheel, 
you will refer to this guide less and less and 
discover the pride to getting a piece of code to work on your own.
If you have tried everything here and are still confused, 
please email mail@spinwearables.com with your problem and we can help sort it out.
