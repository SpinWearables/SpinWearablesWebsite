Elise's Outline for the lesson

Introduction of vectors as having magnitude and direction

Use of angles to represent direction

example of a ball rolling down a slope

We can describe motion through the competing forces acting on an object

Kinematics encompasses motion of objects through space by describing their speed and direction. 

Speed/Velocity

acceleration/Inertia 
(Examples of differentially massed objects)
