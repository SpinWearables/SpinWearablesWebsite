**Who is your STEM role model?**

My former labmate Kshitiz. He’s now a UCONN professor and what I’d call a “social” scientist. He takes the time to get to know people and builds interesting scientific collaborations in the process!

**What is your favorite part about doing STEM outreach?**

When I was in high school, I enjoyed the challenge of my math and science classes, but I didn’t have a good sense of the career paths that were available to me. Participating in science outreach gives me the opportunity to make STEM careers tangible to students and to teach them about the impact that scientists and engineers have every day!
