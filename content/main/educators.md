<p>With the SpinWheel, we have created a device that is perfect for hands-on learning to supplement traditional classroom lessons. Our educational materials will include sample lesson plans for short demos that teachers can integrate into their existing lessons, longer activities that allow students to use the SpinWheel to explore scientific phenomoma without a computer, and longer activities to teach programming using the SpinWheel. We elaborate on some of these ideas below. </p>

If you have access to computers for each student (or for groups of students), the SpinWheel adventures provided with the device will enable your students to gain experience coding.

<p>The SpinWheel can be used for an hour long introductory lesson to simply expose them to programming thinking or many lessons as part of a longer module to allow the students to gain confidence with programming through the Arduino platform. With a classroom kit, we will provide supplemental materials to enable you to lead these lessons whether or not you have programmed before. Further, we are happy to work with educators to expand on the provided lessons to tailor the experience to the curriculum you are seeking to cover.</p>

The SpinWheel also provides opportunities to explore scientific phenomenom, such as gravity and optics, without a computer.

<p>Our educational materials will include lessons that do not require a computer for each SpinWheel being used. For instance, one of the adventures that will come in our educational guide will take the student through learning to program the SpinWheel to become a compass. In addition to the programming activity, we will also include supplemental lessons and activities for exploring magnetism using both a physical compass (of the type students are probably more comfortable with) and SpinWheels that are pre-loaded with the compass program.</p>
