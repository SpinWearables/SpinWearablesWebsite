**What is the focus of your research?**

I use computers to study how the cells in our bodies make proteins(very small building blocks that make up everything in your body). By replicating the cell within a computer, I can make changes that test how a cell will respond!

**Why did you decide to go to grad school?**

I really liked math growing up, and always knew I wanted to be an engineer. It wasn’t until college that I realized that human biology can be understood through math equations! Now in graduate school, I’m the one writing the equations to understand our bodies and cells!

**What is your favorite part about doing STEM outreach?**

At outreach events, middle school and high school students are often approaching activities (and the science behind those activities) for the first time, I love seeing the excitement as a student gets a hard concept for the first time.
