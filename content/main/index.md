**Introducing the SpinWheel:** A small programmable, sensor-enabled trinket, facilitating student exploration of Physics and Computer Science. The SpinWheel can be worn as jewelry, sported as a keychain, or used as a compass. It comes with a Science and Exploration Field Guide containing multiple educational and artistic activities. The students will be able to program the SpinWheel, creating a unique, science-infused piece of art that they would be proud to wear and call their own.

We will launch the SpinWheel on Kickstarter for a run of a 1000 units. All proceeds will go to the science outreach efforts
of the Yale graduate student section of the Society of Women Engineers.

[We are a group of volunteers](/team) with a passion for teaching science and building beautiful things. We work under the umbrella of Yale's Society of Women Engineers, leading hands-on outreach events with hundreds of K-12 students each year. The SpinWheel is the kit that we wish that we had had before going to college!

Our STEM backgrounds provided us with the technical expertise to design the SpinWheel. We made the SpinWheel aesthetically-pleasing and wrote the educational materials assuming [no prior experience](/for_parents) to help make STEM more accessible.

The crowdfunding campaign will be **launched March 16th**. The device is fully built and tested. We just need to raise enough resources for a manufacturing run.
