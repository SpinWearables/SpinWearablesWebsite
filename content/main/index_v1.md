subtitle: Children have the natural curiosity and capacity to engineer a better world. <br> Our kits just remind them.
fancy-panel: "Introducing the SpinWheel: A small programmable, motion-sensing, light-emitting, wearable trinket, enabling student exploration of Physics and Computer Science. The SpinWheel can be worn as jewelry, sported as a keychain, or used as a compass. It comes with a Science and Exploration Field Guide, including multiple educational and artistic activities. The students will be able to program the SpinWheel, creating a unique, science-infused piece of art that they would be proud to wear and call their own."
