**Girl Scout Engineering Day**  
On October 26, 2019, Yale Grad SWE hosted its second annual Girl Scout Engineering Day! Girl Scouts from nearby troops in Connecticut learned all about electrical engineering through two different activities: making LED greeting cards and designing their own Arduino-powered Girl Scout patches. Our first activity, LED greetings cards, served as an introduction to designing an electrical circuit. Students used copper tape to create their circuit, with the challenge of lighting up an LED light. 
Next, students built their own Girl Scout patches, complete with a Lilypad Arduino, a customizable blinking LED light, and colorful felt. They learned to connect their circuit components, and learned some Arduino programming to customize their LED color and blinking pattern. Some students even programmed their Arduinos to flash in Morse code!
