This page pulls together some resources that we found useful along our journey. This isn't meant to be an all encompassing list, but we hope will get you started. These aren't endorsed by SWE and are certainly not all of the excellent resources out there. None of this should be taken as legal advice. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out with any questions. Best of luck!
