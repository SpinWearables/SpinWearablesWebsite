For the last few years, our team has run educational events that have enabled
thousands of attendees to experience the wonder of creating their own gadgets
through science and engineering. Most of our work has been under the umbrella
of [Yale's Graduate Society of Women
Engineers](https://swe.sites.yale.edu/gradswe-0), and in particular, their
[Engineering Day K-12 program](https://engineeringday.com). We are proud to have
channeled our passion for creating, teaching, and civil service to empower the
next generation of makers. Through SpinWearables, we hope to reach even more
students. All of the proceeds will go to funding the outreach events we run,
providing free materials to students and teachers.

If you want to get in touch or have any questions, email [mail@spinwearables.com](mailto:mail@spinwearables.com).

<h1>Becky</h1>
<h2>Molecular Bioengineering</h2>
[Becky](/becky) decided to pursue biomedical engineering so she could use her skills in math and science to improve human health. As a graduate student at Yale, however, she has discovered a second passion: teaching engineering skills to the next generation of college students. Having come from a small high school with limited STEM offerings, she recognizes the value of early exposure to hands-on technical projects--not only for building skills but building confidence as well. She is excited to reach even more students through SpinWearables.

<h1>Bridget</h1>
<h2>Computational Microbiology</h2>
As a kid, [Bridget](/bridget) was always asking "why?" Luckily, her parents put up with her incessant questioning and taught her to love the process of discovering new information. Bridget continues to pursue answers to her questions as a researcher at the University of Michigan, studying the microbes that survive in buildings. Outside of the lab, she shares her love of science and engineering by designing and leading activities that help participants, particularly girls, envision themselves as engineers. Through SpinWearables, she is excited to develop educational kits to inspire the next generation of engineers.

<h1>Chris</h1>
<h2>Neutrino Physics</h2>
While a graduate student at Yale, [Chris](/chris) was involved with many outreach activities in Yale's Pathways to Science program, leading events for hundreds of students. Chris's research at Yale focused on understanding the nature of the neutrino particle by searching for rare nuclear decays. After finishing his PhD, he now works as a Data Scientist for CarMax, but still remains active in STEM outreach. In his free time, Chris enjoys reading, hiking, and traveling around the world.

<h1>Elise</h1>
<h2>Computational Bioengineering</h2>
[Elise](/elise) is a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Yale University, specifically studying biological system dynamics in cells with a focus on signalling pathways in HIV. In high school, she was encouraged in her scientific journey by mentors and teachers who provided key guideposts for STEM success. She is thankful for the strong STEM outreach community at Yale, who strive to inspire the next generation to pursue STEM.

<h1>Emily</h1>
<h2>Experimental Cosmology</h2>
[Emily](/emily) is a PhD student in the Yale
Physics Department. She spends most of her time building instruments for radio
telescopes, and flying drones to measure these radio telescopes. This is all
with the goal of understanding “Dark Energy”, which is this mysterious form of
energy in the universe that is causing it to expand in an accelerating way. She
also enjoys hiking, playing the flute, taking photos, SWE outreach, and hanging
with her dog Cary.

<h1>Hannah</h1>
<h2>Physics</h2>
Hannah is a PhD student in the Yale Physics Department. She works on the ALICE experiment which is a detector on the world’s largest machine; the Large Hadron Collider. There, she studies the results of the extremely hot and dense heavy-ion collisions which are designed to recreate the conditions of the early universe. Outside of physics, Hannah is a fan of almost anything outside. Whether it’s running, hiking, yoga, rock climbing, or skiing - she is always up for some time outside with friends!

<h1>Jack</h1>
<h2>Materials Engineering</h2>
Jack has always been passionate about both art and science. As a high schooler, he started an online business LiveWire ArtWorks to sell his jewelry and wire sculptures--much of which was inspired by nature. While at Brown, understanding the complexity and imaging the beauty of materials captivated his imagination and led him to major in materials engineering. Through TAing and tutoring for engineering courses, Jack discovered the joy of sharing science with others. Jack acts as an artistic consultant for the SpinWearables team.

<h1>Jenna</h1>
<h2>Atmospheric Chemistry</h2>
[Jenna](/jenna) is a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Engineering at Yale. She studies the complex mixture of organic compounds in the atmosphere, and how chemical changes at the molecular-level may impact the overall health and environmental effects of the air we breathe. She loves working with the SpinWearables team and the Yale Society of Women Engineers outreach team to share and explore the exciting world of STEM with middle and high school students.

<h1>Jennifer</h1>
<h2>Computational Biology</h2>
Jennifer uses computers to understand the structure of proteins. She loves teaching and seeks to ensure that the content she presents is accessible to all students. As a grad student at Yale, Jennifer shared her love of science with students through outreach programs to inspire others to consider a career in STEM. She recently finished a postdoc at UMass Med and is about to start a combined research and teaching position at Tufts. With the time between these positions she is excited to have joined the SpinWearables team to help hone the educational materials.

<h1>Sam</h1>
<h2>Neutrino Physics</h2>
[Sam](/samantha) is a Physics graduate student at Yale studying neutrino physics.
Neutrinos are weird particles, and understanding their mysterious properties might answer
major questions about matter and the universe. For example, this field could uncover knowledge
about how the universe formed. Outside of the lab, she enjoys hiking, running, and reading good
books. With unlimited time and brainpower, she might also be studying history and art.

<h1>Stefan</h1>
<h2>Quantum Information</h2>
Since high school [Stefan](/stefan) has enjoyed sharing the wonders of science with
others, organizing extraculicular courses and summer break Physics events.
While a graduate student at Yale's Quantum Institute he felt most at home in
Yale's makerspace, preparing contraptions to be used in middle- and high-school
outreach events. He now continues his reasearch work on photonic quantum
computers jointly at MIT and Harvard, but spends much of his free time
designing hands-on outreach materials, including the SpinWheel.

<h1>Tess</h1>
<h2>Sustainable Structural Engineering</h2>
Tess is currently a PhD student in Stanford's Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and she's passionate about making the buildings we live and work in more sustainable through her research. Female mentors, such as her older sister, have played a large role in her interest in engineering, and so she enjoys inspiring younger girls to pursue careers in STEM. She also loves opportunities to use her graphic design skills for good causes, such as through Stanford's Graduate Society of Women Engineers and the SpinWheel!
