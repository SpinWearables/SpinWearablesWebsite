For the last few years, our team has run educational events that have enabled
thousands of attendees to experience the wonder of creating their own gadgets
through science and engineering. Most of our work has been under the umbrella
of [Yale's Graduate Society of Women
Engineers](https://swe.sites.yale.edu/gradswe-0), and in particular, their
[Engineering Day K-12 program](https://engineeringday.com). We are proud to have
channeled our passion for creating, teaching, and civil service to empower the
next generation of makers. Through SpinWearables, we hope to reach even more
students. All of the proceeds will go to funding the outreach events we run,
providing free materials to students and teachers. 

If you want to get in touch or have any questions, email [mail@spinwearables.com](mailto:mail@spinwearables.com).

<h1>Becky</h1>
<h2>Molecular Bioengineering</h2>
[Becky](/becky) decided to pursue biomedical engineering so she could use her skills in math and science to improve human health. As a graduate student at Yale, however, she has discovered a second passion: teaching engineering skills to the next generation of college students. Having come from a small high school with limited STEM offerings, she recognizes the value of early exposure to hands-on technical projects--not only for building skills but building confidence as well. She is excited to reach even more students through SpinWearables.

<h1>Bridget</h1>
<h2>Computational Microbiology</h2>
As a kid, [Bridget](/bridget) was always asking "why?" Luckily, her parents put up with her incessant questioning and taught her to love the process of discovering new information. Bridget continues to pursue answers to her questions as a researcher at the University of Michigan, studying the microbes that survive in buildings. Outside of the lab, she shares her love of science and engineering by designing and leading activities that help participants, particularly girls, envision themselves as engineers. Through SpinWearables, she is excited to develop educational kits to inspire the next generation of engineers.

<h1>Elise</h1>
<h2>Computational Bioengineering</h2>
Elise is a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Yale University, specifically studying biological system dynamics in cells with a focus on signalling pathways in HIV. In high school, she was encouraged in her scientific journey by mentors and teachers who provided key guideposts for STEM success. She is thankful for the strong STEM outreach community at Yale, who strive to inspire the next generation to pursue STEM.

<div>
<h1>Emily</h1>
<h2>Experimental Cosmology</h2>
Emily is a PhD student in the Yale
Physics Department. She spends most of her time building instruments for radio
telescopes, and flying drones to measure these radio telescopes. This is all
with the goal of understanding “Dark Energy”, which is this mysterious form of
energy in the universe that is causing it to expand in an accelerating way. She
also enjoy hiking, playing the flute, taking photos, SWE outreach, and hanging
with her dog Cary.

<h1>Jenna</h1>
<h2>Atmospheric Chemistry</h2>
[Jenna](/jenna) is a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Engineering at Yale. She studies the complex mixture of organic compounds in the atmosphere, and how chemical changes at the molecular-level may impact the overall health and environmental effects of the air we breathe. She loves working with the SpinWearables team and the Yale Society of Women Engineers outreach team to share and explore the exciting world of STEM with middle and high school students.

<h1>Sam</h1>
<h2>Neutrino Physics</h2>
Sam is a Physics graduate student at Yale studying neutrino physics.
Neutrinos are weird particles, and understanding their mysterious properties might answer
major questions about matter and the universe. For example, this field could uncover knowledge
about how the universe formed. Outside of the lab, she enjoy hiking, running, and reading good
books. With unlimited time and brainpower, she might also be studying history and art.

<h1>Stefan</h1>
<h2>Quantum Information</h2>
Since high school Stefan has enjoyed sharing the wonders of science with
others, organizing extraculicular courses and summer break Physics events.
While a graduate student at Yale's Quantum Institute he felt most at home in
Yale's makerspace, preparing contraptions to be used in middle- and high-school
outreach events. He now continues his reasearch work on photonic quantum
computers jointly at MIT and Harvard, but spends much of his free time
designing hands-on outreach materials, including the SpinWheel.

<div>
<h1>Jack</h1>
<h2>Materials Engineering</h2>
Jack has always been passionate about both art and science. As a high schooler, he started an online business LiveWire ArtWorks to sell his jewelry and wire sculptures--much of which was inspired by nature. While at Brown, understanding the complexity and imaging the beauty of materials captivated his imagination and led him to major in materials engineering. Through TAing and tutoring for engineering courses, Jack discovered the joy of sharing science with others. Jack acts as an artistic consultant for the SpinWearables team.
